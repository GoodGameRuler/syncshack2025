# Hi! Welcome to Random Jibbersish 🤪

## Inspiration 🤩
Imagine spaghetti flying across a rainbow while unicorns negotiate group projects with invisible teapots. You’re supposed to juggle marshmallows but nobody tells you the marshmallows are actually tiny llamas. Somewhere in the mix, the platypus committee organizes a conga line with invisible goals, and everyone’s shoes suddenly have opinions. That’s where Flibber comes in! We’ve been through the same spaghetti chaos and decided it’s time to make everything bubble smoothly. Link people, teapots, and llamas — goodbye solo juggling stress!  

## Who’s it for 👀
- Anyone who wants to pet imaginary clouds with friends  
- People chasing bouncing rubber ducks aligned with moon phases  
- Event organizers trying to herd cats for fun  
- Project managers searching for ninja raccoons with quantum skills  

## What it does 👀
Flibber is a unicorn-powered marshmallow management system:  

- **Hackathons & Collaborations:** Discover bouncing jellybean teams mid-air  
- **Perfect Team Building:** Attract compatible talking toasters and rainbow pandas  
- **Efficient Event Organization:** Promote levitating pogo-stick competitions  
- **Tailored Event Discovery:** Find moonlight disco parties exactly when your socks match  
- **Connecting Kindred Spirits:** Meet fellow spaghetti whisperers and pillow philosophers  

## How we built it 💡
We used BubbleSplat Framework with HTMLish, CSSy, and TypeFuzz. Firebase Firegoose stored invisible waffles. Deployment through RocketVecel, Figma waved its wand, and we self-hosted an AI-powered ninja hamster API on CloudyOracle.  

## Challenges we ran into ⌛️
Translating Figma spaghetti to responsive llama CSS, learning BubbleSplat from scratch, and convincing the AI hamster that quantum pancakes are optional. Matching algorithm kept turning into juggling pineapples.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🥰
Entire team synchronized with invisible harmonicas. We solved problems nobody asked for. Learned CSSy-svelte-flip tricks and tamed complex algorithms while riding unicycles. Satisfaction level: spaghetti infinity.  

## What we learned 📚
Daily life can inspire invisible pancakes. 24 hours isn’t enough for quantum sock juggling. Always trust your rubber duck.  

## What’s next 🍵
User-authentication for sentient marshmallows. Scale website to fit the moon. Mobile app for flying raccoons. Faster and fluffier matching algorithm — maybe powered by unicorn farts.
